****Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic Dataset
*Overview
This repository provides a theoretical guide for performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset, available on Kaggle, is a popular dataset used to explore data analysis techniques and machine learning models. This guide outlines the steps to clean the dataset and conduct a thorough EDA to uncover patterns and trends.

*Purpose
The primary goals of this analysis are to:

*Clean the Data: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
*Explore the Data: Perform EDA to understand the distribution of variables, identify relationships between variables, and discover patterns and trends.
Data Cleaning
*Handling Missing Values:

*Identify columns with missing values.
Decide on appropriate strategies for handling them, such as imputing missing values with the mean, median, or mode, or removing rows or columns with significant missing data.
*Removing Duplicates:Check for and remove any duplicate rows to ensure the dataset's integrity.
 *Correcting Data Types:Ensure that all columns have the correct data types, such as converting categorical variables to categorical data types and numerical variables to appropriate numerical types.
 ***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*Univariate Analysis:Analyze the distribution of individual variables.
For continuous variables, use histograms to understand their distribution.
For categorical variables, use bar charts to visualize the frequency of each category.

*Bivariate Analysis:Explore relationships between two variables.
Use scatter plots to examine relationships between numerical variables.
Use bar plots or other appropriate visualizations to compare categorical variables against numerical outcomes.

*Multivariate Analysis:Investigate interactions between multiple variables.
Use techniques such as grouped bar plots or pair plots to understand how multiple factors affect the outcomes.
Patterns and Trends
***During the analysis, you may uncover various insights such as:

*Survival Rates by Age and Gender: Determine how survival rates differ by age and gender.
*Impact of Fare and Class on Survival: Explore how fare prices and passenger class affect survival rates.
*General Data Insights: Identify any additional patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data that may be relevant for further analysis or modeling.
***Conclusion
The steps outlined above will help you clean and analyze the Titanic dataset effectively. By following these guidelines, you can gain valuable insights into the data and prepare it for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
